# NoSQL Social Network API


## Description
This project was created for the week 18 challange of my coding bootcamp. The goal of this challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.
```
User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
```
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
